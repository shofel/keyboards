# Mods: vert combos with one shot and suspending the ru layer

## How
- make a feature-toggle to disable/enable sm_td
- implement feature by feature

## 1. get callum's oneshot
put files in the directory
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callum-oakley/qmk_firmware/refs/heads/master/users/callum/oneshot.h
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callum-oakley/qmk_firmware/refs/heads/master/users/callum/oneshot.c

make a simple oneshot key with callum , then wi


1. copy from callum one-shot
when
    mod down,
    mod queued
-> suspend_ru

Progression
1. callum one-shot for a simple key
2. oneshot for combos
3. with suspending ru

During the work, keep config 

### Assure:
* combos for ({[<>]})
* combo for esc
* remove combos for mod+esc. one-shot is perfect for this

* switch lang
  - simple = keys on fn_sys layer
  - as before = KK_RU: tap->ru taptap->en esc->en
* switch unicode input mode

### After
- cleanup sm_td
- to cancel one shot: not esc, but a dedicated key (0,0)
