*** Mods: vert combos with one shot

1. copy from callum one-shot
when
    mod down,
    mod queued
-> suspend_ru

Progression
1. callum one-shot for a simple key
2. oneshot for a combo
3. with suspending ru

### Assure:
* combos for ({[<>]})
* combo for esc
* remove combos for mod+esc. one-shot is perfect for this

* switch lang
  - simple = keys on fn_sys layer
  - as before = tap->en taptap->ru esc->en
* switch unicode input mode

### After
cleanup sm_td
